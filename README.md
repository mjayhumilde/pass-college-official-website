## What is this?

This is a prototype (a working example) for the official website of Pass College. It's built using web technologies like JavaScript and aims to create a modern online presence for the school. Think of it as a first step towards the final website.

## What can it do right now?

This prototype shows some of the important things the website will be able to do:

- **Show information about the school:** A homepage with the school's main points. Sections for programs, facilities, and good things the school has done. Pictures and videos to make it interesting.
- **Display Announcements:** A place to see important news and upcoming events from the school.
- **Request Documents:** A way for students (current and future) to ask for school documents like transcripts. It has forms to fill out.
- **User Logins with Different Roles:** A system where different people (like admins, teachers, and regular users) can log in and see different things or have different abilities on the website.
- **Suggest Courses:** A quiz for new students to find out which courses might be a good fit for them based on their interests.

## Technologies Used

This prototype uses these web tools:

- **React:** A tool that helps build the interactive parts of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A tool that makes it easy to style the website and make it look good quickly.
- **HTML:** The basic structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** How the website looks (colors, fonts, layout).
- **JavaScript:** Makes the website interactive.

## Where is it now?

This is a **development prototype**, which means it's still being worked on and is a first version to show the main ideas. Not everything might be finished or perfect yet. The login system and the course quiz are important parts that show how users can interact with the site.
