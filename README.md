## What is this?

This is a prototype (a working example) for the official website of Pass College. It's built using web technologies like JavaScript and aims to create a modern online presence for the school. Think of it as a first step towards the final website.

## What can it do right now?

This prototype shows some of the important things the website will be able to do:

- **Show information about the school:** A homepage with the school's main points. Sections for programs, facilities, and good things the school has done. Pictures and videos to make it interesting.
- **Display Announcements:** A place to see important news and upcoming events from the school.
- **Request Documents:** A way for students (current and future) to ask for school documents like transcripts. It has forms to fill out.
- **User Logins with Different Roles:** A system where different people (like admins, teachers, and regular users) can log in and see different things or have different abilities on the website.
- **Suggest Courses:** A quiz for new students to find out which courses might be a good fit for them based on their interests.

## Technologies Used

This prototype uses these web tools:

- **React:** A tool that helps build the interactive parts of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A tool that makes it easy to style the website and make it look good quickly.
- **HTML:** The basic structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** How the website looks (colors, fonts, layout).
- **JavaScript:** Makes the website interactive.

## Where is it now?

This is a **development prototype**, which means it's still being worked on and is a first version to show the main ideas. Not everything might be finished or perfect yet. The login system and the course quiz are important parts that show how users can interact with the site.

## For Developers (If you want to help or look at the code):

1.  **Get the code:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

    _(Replace the link above with the actual link to the code)_

2.  **Go into the code folder:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install the tools the project needs:**

    ```bash
    npm install   # or if you use Yarn, type: yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the website on your computer:**
    ```bash
    npm start     # or if you use Yarn, type: yarn start
    ```
    This will usually open the website in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) at `http://localhost:3000`.

## What could be added later?

Here are some ideas for what could be done to make the website even better in the future:

- Connect the website to a **database** to save information.
- Build the **backend** (the behind-the-scenes part) to handle logins and the quiz.
- Make the
